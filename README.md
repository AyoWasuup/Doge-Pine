# Doge-Pine
i3-gaps config made by *icebox*.<br />
spotify support seems unnecasary, for me it's the best part
<br /><br />
# need (including i3-gaps, ofc):
polybar<br />
feh<br />
rofi (start menu and shutdown)<br />
gimp (for screenshots)<br />
Hack Nerd font 10 (it works in some terminals by default but if it's not installed onto the system polybar will ignore it)
<br /><br />
# install process
install this repo for rofi themes: https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi/tree/master<br />
make the type 6 launcher file in .config/rofi use style 10<br />
install the Doge-Pine repo<br />
clone the installed files from doge-pine into your /home/user directory<br />
<br /><br />
# thanks for installing
